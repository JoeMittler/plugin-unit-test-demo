# WordCamp Paris 2015 : Unit Testing your WordPress plugins

[![wordpress-plugin-unit-tests-fr-wordcamp-paris-2015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/223647/5892578/993e2554-a4c4-11e4-90ba-465beef4634d.jpg)](http://slideshare.net/ozh/wordpress-plugin-unit-tests-fr-wordcamp-paris-2015)

This plugin is a demo made for my talk at WordCamp Paris 2015 about unit testing your WordPress plugins.

Link to my slides: http://slideshare.net/ozh/wordpress-plugin-unit-tests-fr-wordcamp-paris-2015 (in French)

The presentation is rather huge (100 slides) and I didn't show all the slides but I thought it would be interesting anyway to leave all the material available. Most slides should be mostly self explanatory.

Tests are [failing](https://travis-ci.org/ozh/plugin-unit-test-demo/) on Travis with WP 3.8 (the defaut environment matrix generated by WP-CLI) and left as-is as an example.
